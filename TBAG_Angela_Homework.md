### Scene Concept / Ideas

- [ ] Briefly describe the scene and the individual components that you would like to re-create auditively with a few bullet points. What is your "Filmuni sound"?
	- I already had realised before the beginning of this class that the railing across the bridge in the Filmuni sounds nice when being hit. I used the microphone kind of like a contact-microphone by pressing it onto the railing. Also for the rest of the sounds I recurringly  
### Recording (DONE)

- [x] Work with a recording device ([Zoom H2n](https://www.zoom.co.jp/sites/default/files/products/downloads/pdfs/D_H2n_0.pdf) or [H4n](https://zoomcorp.com/media/documents/D_H4n_Pro_QuickGuide.pdf)) and capture various sounds at Filmuni. Explore the recorders' settings such as 
    - input meter (avoid _clipping_)
    - sampling rate ((44k or) 48k is a default setting)
    - bit depth (24 bit is a default setting)
    - Microphone settings (more on [microphone patterns here](https://cmtext.indiana.edu/studio/chapter2_mics4.php))
    - Take notes or store the settings' details in the file name!!!


### Editing (DONE)

- [x] Create a new project in your DAW
- [x] Create and add your recorded tracks to the projects
- [x] Checkout how to specify the sampling rate and sample format/bit depth in the DAW. 
    - [x] Explore how the recorings sound like when the settings in the DAW differ from the settings used for the recordings.
    - [x] Take recordings in your DAW at various small/medium/high values of bit depths and sampling rate. What do you encounter?
- Use panning and volume to position different elements in your sound scene.
- Explore and use free sounds from digital libraries like [freesound](https://freesound.org/).

#### Technical Workflow

Note down your technical workflow with a few bullet points:

- What kind of microphone setting did you use and why, regarding 
    - sampling rate
    - bit depth
    - microphone patterns

#### Reading Material

To recap and dive into more on studio material:

- [Introduction to Computer Music / Chapt. 2: Studio Gear](https://cmtext.indiana.edu/studio/chapter2_intro.php)

## History Research | Add-on (2 pts)

- [ ] Recap the slides on digital audio history. What are the central perspectives on music, sound and technology that you draw from the slides in terms of

- techniques
- technology
- musical style

- [x] Can you find other interesting artists (m/f/d) who have had a decisive influence on the development of music and technologies, technology and music?

	Daphne Oram and Suzanne Ciani played key roles in the development of music technology. Oram's Oramics Machine was one of the earliest synthesizer designs, and Ciani helped bring the Buchla synthesizer into wider use, influencing the development of electronic music.
	
	On the artistic side, Imogen Heap continues to incorporate technology into the music-making process, introducing a new way of performing music with her Mi.Mu gloves, SOPHIE reshaped hyperpop with experimental sound design, and Arca expanded electronic music's possibilities while challenging conventions of identity. I'm also including the last three because I've been a fan of their music for a long time and their work also serves as an inspiration to me.
## Theory & Research (2 pts)

- [ ] Do research on the following topics:

- dBFS
	- Decibels relative to full scale
	- dBFS gets assigned to the maximum possible digital level of 0 db
- Phase
	- 
- Aliasing
	- 
- Clipping 
	- 

Include the following aspects into your answers:

- short description about what the topic is about and in which context it appears
- one example that illustrates the topic (or more examples if needed)
## Practical Exercise (8 pts) (DONE)

**Practical Exercise: Creating a 3D Sound Image**

**Objective:**  
This exercise focuses on creating a _sound image_—an immersive, three-dimensional audio scene using only the provided audio materials and a limited set of tools. You’ll explore how to convey spatial relationships through sound placement, helping listeners navigate a scene and understand the positions of audio elements in a virtual space. This project will strengthen your skills in audio spatiality, storytelling, and mixing.

**Instructions:**

1. **Setup**
    
    - Open the [referenced REAPER project](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/4KnrFOgQC6en2t5) and load the provided individual WAV files, you might also use the DAW of your choice. These files are your only sound sources—no synthesizers or additional audio samples should be used.
2. **Positioning and Storytelling**
    
    - Arrange the audio objects in a virtual 3D sound space. Focus on creating a story or scene where each sound has a deliberate position (e.g., front, back, left, right) and plays a specific role.
    - Guide your listener through the sound scene, positioning sounds in a way that makes their locations and movements easy to follow and engaging.
3. **Tools and Effects Constraints**
    
    - Use only volume, pan, reverb FX, and delay FX to craft your sound image.
    - Avoid all other audio effects, maintaining a focus on these basic parameters to shape your space.
    - Apply reverb and delay subtly to simulate depth and distance but avoid heavy processing to keep the audio clear and distinct. There are two PDF files that introduce both audio FX.
4. **Automation and Dynamics**
    
    - Investigate REAPER's automation tools to control parameters like volume, pan, reverb, and delay over time. This will allow you to create movement and dynamics within your scene.
    - Experiment with fading elements in and out or panning them across the stereo field to enhance the spatial storytelling effect.
5. **Outcome**
    
    - By the end of this exercise, you should have a three-dimensional sound scene that uses spatial positioning to convey a sense of space and direction. The goal is to bring an idea to life in audio, practicing how to create an immersive, clear, and structured sound image within a minimal setup.
    - Create a mixdown of 1, maximum 2 minutes in length.

This exercise encourages a disciplined approach to sound design, focusing on spatiality and storytelling through careful, controlled use of basic audio parameters.
